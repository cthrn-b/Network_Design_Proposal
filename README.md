# Network Design Proposal

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Network Design Proposal** for ABC Corporation, focusing on **scalability, redundancy, and hierarchical network architecture** to meet the organizationâ€™s current and future networking needs.

## Objectives
- Design a scalable and redundant network for a **multi-branch** organization.
- Implement a **hierarchical network model** (Core, Distribution, Access layers).
- Ensure high availability and **fault tolerance** with redundancy mechanisms.
- Define **technology choices** (hardware, protocols, security measures).
- Provide **network diagrams** illustrating the design.

## Network Architecture
### 1. **Hierarchical Network Design**
- **Core Layer:** High-speed backbone connectivity with layer 3 switches and routers.
- **Distribution Layer:** Traffic routing between offices, enforcing QoS and security policies.
- **Access Layer:** User connectivity, VLAN segmentation, and switch deployments.

### 2. **Scalability Considerations**
- Modular design for easy expansion.
- Dynamic routing (OSPF/EIGRP) for adaptability.
- Cloud integration for future scalability.

### 3. **Redundancy & High Availability**
- Backup links and failover configurations.
- Redundant routers, switches, and load balancers.
- Automatic failover mechanisms in the data center and branch offices.

### 4. **Technology Choices**
- **Hardware:** Enterprise-grade routers, layer 3 switches, firewalls.
- **Protocols:** OSPF, BGP, VLANs, QoS.
- **Security Measures:** VPN, Firewalls, Encryption, Access Control.

## Network Diagrams
- **Hierarchical Design Diagram** (Core, Distribution, Access layers).
- **Redundancy Diagram** (Backup links, failover mechanisms).
